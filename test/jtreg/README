IcedJTReg
---------

This is a special "merge" of jtharness and jtreg to be compiled and
run against the OpenJDK included in IcedTea. Please ONLY use this for
testing inside the IcedTea environment. This is NOT a general jtreg
and/or jtharness (source) distribution. In particular this version
does NOT include support for javax.help, javax.servlet, javax.comm,
junit, ant or the sun.com.jct classes. It is just a bare bones version
that can be compiled and run against a "bare" JDK without needing any
external libraries.

PLEASE DO NOT PACKAGE AND DISTRIBUTE SEPARATELY FROM ICEDTEA

For the full versions of jtharness and jtreg see:

- http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/
- https://jtharness.dev.java.net/

This version is based on:

- jtharness-oss-4_1_3a-dev
- jtreg-4_0-src-b02-15_oct_2008 with change backported from                    
  jtreg-4.1-src-b02_21_may_2010.zip. This change adds support for              
  option named "process" which can be used along with tag "compile".           

IcedJTReg is distrubuted under the GPLv2.0, like jtreg and jtharness.
