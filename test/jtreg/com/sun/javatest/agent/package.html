  <body>

    <p>The JT Harness Agent provides a way to run tests on a small 
      platform with limited resources, under the control of the  
      JT Harness test harness, which needs to run on a workstation
      using Java(TM) 2 Standard Edition. Communication between
      the JT Harness test harness and the JT Harness Agent is handled
      using streams on top of TCP/IP, or serial lines.

    <p>The classes in the package are divided into two groups:
      those that must run on a small platform device, and those that
      may run as part of the main JT Harness test harness. The classes
      that must run on a small device are limited to use APIs
      as specified for JDK 1.1 or similar.

    <p>The JT Harness harness does not talk directly to the agent;
      instead, a test suite will specify the use of the agent as
      needed in its configuration data via plug in 
      {@link com.sun.javatest.Command commands}. As such, there
      is little that is special about the JT Harness Agent as such,
      and alternative mechanisms to communicate with small platform
      devices could be used instead.
