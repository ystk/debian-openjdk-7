/**
 * Class to manage custom menus.  This class allows the test suite architect to
 * add various custom menu items to designated places in the menu system of the
 * Test Manager.  The constants in this class represent those designated
 * positions and are semantic locations, not absolute.  This allows
 * reorganziation of menus at the harness level without necessarily breaking
 * the positioning that the architect expected.
 *
 * This class can be used in two ways.  First, the concrete class overrides
 * <code>getMenuItems()</code> to return the correct set of items for the given
 * category.  This method may be the simplist for straight forward insertions.
 * The second method is to use <code>addMenuItem()</code> to sequentially
 * specify which menu items should appear.  The default implementation of
 * <code>getMenuItems()</code> will use data provided by using this second
 * method.
 *
 * By default, no menu category will have any custom menus (<code>getMenuItems()</code>
 * will always return null).
 *
 * The <code>JMenuItem</code> objects may be "pull-right" menus if desired.  It is
 * the responsibility of the archtect to manage keystoke nmeumonics.
