  <body>
    The JT Harness Tool API provides the command-line and GUI 
    infrastructure for the main JT Harness test harness. 
    It provides for an extensible set of {@link com.sun.javatest.tool.Tool tools},
    managed by corresponding {@link com.sun.javatest.tool.ToolManager tool managers}.
    Tools may be run in batch mode, or may be displayed in one
    of a number of different {@link com.sun.javatest.tool.Desktop desktop styles}.
    The state of a desktop can be saved on exit, and restored
    when the application is next restarted. The tools and the
    desktop may also use {@link com.sun.javatest.tool.Preferences user preferences}
    to control their appearance.
