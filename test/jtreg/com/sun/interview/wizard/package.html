    <h1>Interview Wizard</h1>

    <p>This package provides a "wizard-style" GUI for a presenting the 
    {@link com.sun.interview.Question questions} contained in
    an {@link com.sun.interview.Interview interview}.
      
    <p>The GUI can be hosted in either a frame or a dialog box. 
      Within that, it provides three panels:
      <ul>
      <li>a panel that displays a "table of contents"
	of the current set of questions
      <li>a panel that contains the text of the current
	question, and a suitable response area
      <li>a panel that provides embedded help for the current
	question.
    </ul>
    In addition, buttons are provided for navigating around the interview,
    dismissing the GUI, and so on.
